# Bored - Revision 1
A compact 65% (14x5) ortholinear keyboard kit.

Rev 1 was my first attempt at laying out an ortholinear keybard in a standard case, broken down as:
* A left macro column of 1.25U
* A "Preonic" 12x5 grid
* A right macro column of 1.25U

---

Likes:
* Use of a standard case really takes the quality up a notch, and it just looks like a store bought keyboard
* Case angle allows:
    * Comfortable use of OEM or Cherry profile caps
    * Reduces distance between keys by trading it for height

Dislikes:
* "Macro" keys are annoyingly placed. Reaching for backspace, my hand overreached and feels the top right macro key. Now I know this is just a me issue, if I trained my fingers a bit better I wouldn't be overreaching, and the more I use this layout the less often I'm missing backspace or escape, but I think it would be nice if this conformed to all the other "small" keyboards. I did try reducing the issue by using lower profile XDA keycaps, which helped quite a bit, but the whole thing looks a little off.
* Looking down at the keyboard (which I know shouldn't happen, but it does from time-to-time), being able to pick the right column is absolutely thrown by the extra left column. Attempting to select 1 usually results in escape.

Next revision ideas:
* Shift the "Preonic" section off to the left, and add a single macro column with some gap
* Shift both hands apart slight and one whole U, giving an extra two central columns. This would also give an extra thumb key per hand
