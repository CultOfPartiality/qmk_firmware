A compact 65% (14x5) ortholinear keyboard kit. [More info on GitHub if I ever release this](https://github.com/CultOfPartiality/customkeyboardpcb/)

Born of the desire to devise my own PCB, build something ortho, but fit an existing off-the-self keyboard case. Well, mostly from being bored during having Covid, and wanting to work on using PCB design software. Sadly due to my addled brain, I used EasyEDA rather than KiCad.

The current version fits the GH60 case, as that was one I found the drawings for, but an Anne Pro formfactor is possible.

Hardware Supported: Rev 1 Hack, rev 2 in the works
Hardware Availability: 4 extra rev 1 PCBs currently on my shelf
