# Userspace - CultOfPartiality

Sick of copying settings from keyboard to keyboard as I keep developing my own layout, I've put all the common layout, code and settings into this userspace as QMK allows. Now, whenever I compile a board with the keymap of "cultofpartiality" this userspace will get included automatically.

## Standardised Layouts
So far I've only got this done for the navigation/raise layer, and only the "inner block" of keys (all those reached one up or down from the eight finger home positions, and the index fingers' inner row). This means the arrow keys, mouse mode keys, and other useful nav keys are always in the same place.

I'd like to start doing this for the symbols/lower layer, but the Planck's number row that I'm currently set on has made that difficult. Hopefully next time I come back to update this doco I'll have some sort of fix for this, which I'm suspecting will be to move the "[" and "]" key down to below the home row rather than above it. Then again, that muscle memory will take a little bit to break.
## Standard settings
### Mouse Mode
Mouse mode has a number of tuning components for speed and accdeleration and delays. As such, when I finally sit down to tune these to work smoothly I'd want these to propagate to the other boards.
