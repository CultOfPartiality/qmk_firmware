Come up with useful combos
Move print screen on planck?
Use symbol layer on left hand for "slow" symbols ("[]" perhaps?)
Easier access to +, =, numpad?
Relocate settings trigger?
Fill blank keys on base layer


Try unified NAV layer to reduce reach for mouse mode button


Rename all layers to standard format, with standard order. Maybe even move the regulars into userspace?
